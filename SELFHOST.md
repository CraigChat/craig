# Self-hosting/installation
Craig can be installed and ran locally. Some use cases for this are:
- Contributing to Craig's source code
- Creating multiple instances of Craig

## Pre-requisites/dependencies
Craig can only be ran on a Linux machine. The installation has been tested on a fresh install of **Ubuntu 22.04** and **Kubuntu 23.10**.

The following `apt` packages will be automatically installed by the install script [install.sh](install.sh):

```
make inkscape ffmpeg flac fdkaac vorbis-tools opus-tools zip unzip lsb-release curl gpg redis postgresql sed coreutils build-essential 
```


## 1. Clone source code

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CraigChat/craig.git
```

## 2. Create a Discord Bot application
We need to create a Discord Bot account for the Craig instance. 

### Required steps

1. Log into [Discord](https://discord.com/)
2. Navigate to the [developer application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Click on `New Application` in the top-right
4. Give your new Craig instance a name (e.g. *LocalCraig* or *MyCraigBot*)
5. Accept terms of service and click `Create`
6. Under `SETTINGS->General Information` take note and copy down the following:
   - **APPLICATION ID** (corresponds to `DISCORD_APP_ID`)
7. Under `SETTINGS->Bot` take note and copy down the following:
   - **TOKEN** (corresponds to `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`)
     - you might have to click `Reset Token` if this is hidden
8. Under `SETTINGS->OAuth2->General` take note and copy down the following:
   - **CLIENT ID** (corresponds to `CLIENT_ID`)
   - **CLIENT SECRET** (correpsonds to `CLIENT_SECRET`)
     - you might have to click `Reset Secret` if this is hidden
9. Under `SETTINGS->OAuth2->General` click on `Add Redirect` and paste in the following URI: http://localhost:3000/api/login
10. Save changes


### Optional steps

#### Upload an app icon for Craig

1. Under `SETTINGS->General Information->APP ICON` click on the photo icon
2. You can use the default one, which is located in the git repo: [apps/download/page/public/craig.png](apps/download/page/public/craig.png). I recommend changing it slightly so as not to get confused with the actual Craig bot

#### Create a development guild (server) for Craig

After installation, your self-hosted instance of Craig can be invited to any Discord server. There is an optional environment variable in [install.config.example](install.config.example) which sets the development server for synchronized slash commands: `DEVELOPMENT_GUILD_ID`. Running `yarn run sync:dev` in the main git repo will then only synchronize commands to that development sever, as opposed to all the servers your Craig bot has been invited to. This gives you a sandbox in which to test experimental slash commands.

1. Follow [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977) to create a Discord server
2. Follow [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498) to obtain your new server's ID

## 3. Edit configuration files

### Required configuration

Copy the example config file in the main directory and rename it

```sh
cp ./install.config.example ./install.config
```

Edit the following environment variables in the newly created [install.config](install.config) file with values you obtained from the previous step:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
DISCORD_APP_ID
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
```
and optionally:

```
DEVELOPMENT_GUILD_ID
```

### Optional and advanced configuration

There are additional configuration variables in [install.config.example](install.config.example), such as Craig's PostgreSQL database username and password, Patreon ID, etc.

There are even more configuration options located in: [apps/bot/config/_default.js](apps/bot/config/_default.js) and [apps/tasks/config/_default.js](apps/tasks/config/_default.js).

Changing some of these variables from their default values will break Craig, so be careful.

## 4. Run install script

Go into the main directory and run the following:

```sh
./install.sh
```

Note that the script will prompt for `sudo` privileges, in order to automatically install dependencies and configure PostgreSQL.

The installation should take a while. Please make note of any errors or warnings. The install generates an output log located in the main directory: [install.log](install.log).

## 5. Invite Craig to a server

You can invite Craig to any Discord server by going to the following URL in your browser. Just make sure to replace `CLIENT_ID` in the URL with the actual value of your Discord Bot's client ID.

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=68176896&scope=bot%20applications.commands

## 6. Try recording

If everything went smoothly up to now, there should be a running instance of Craig on your local machine. Congratulations!

You can try recording and using Craig's slash commands.

## Important information

### Main dashboard

Located at: http://localhost:3000/login


### HTTPS and localhost - can't go to download page

Craig automatically serves the download pages with the `https://` protocol. For example, if you try to go to the download page after recording, the link will be of the form:

https://localhost:5029/rec/RECORDING_ID

Most if not all browsers won't serve this because `localhost` doesn't have a signed certificate for `https://`. You can simply change the protocol to `http://` by removing the `s` and then you will be able to access your recording download:

http://localhost:5029/rec/RECORDING_ID

### Error that Redis package is not signed

When testing with Kubuntu 23.10, the following error stops `sudo apt update` from working, which prematurely exits the install script:

```
E: Failed to fetch https://packages.redis.io/deb/dists/mantic/InRelease  403  Forbidden [IP: 18.173.121.98 443]
E: The repository 'https://packages.redis.io/deb mantic InRelease' is not signed.
```

This occurs because Redis does not have a signature for the Kubuntu 23.10 release (Mantic). 

A workaround is to comment out the first line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list`, i.e.:

```sh
#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb mantic main
```

To avoid having to continually comment this out every time the install script is ran, you can add the `#` directly in [install.sh](install.sh):

```sh
echo "#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
```

This might need to be done for other distributions as well.

### Restarting Craig after reboot

By default, Craig will not automatically restart if you reboot your computer. You can re-run a modified version of [install.sh](install.sh) script so that the following steps are performed:

- Make sure the Redis server is online
- Make sure the PostgreSQL database is online
- Start the application

To speed up the restart (and avoid rebuilding Craig), you should comment out some unnecessary steps (function calls) in the install script:

```sh
# install_apt_packages
# install_node
start_redis
start_postgresql
# config_env
# config_react
# config_yarn
# config_cook
start_app
```

### Monitoring, starting, and stopping Craig

Here are some useful commands for debugging the installation and for monitoring the Craig application. Make sure that you have sourced `nvm` and you are using the installed version of `node` in order to run `pm2` commands:

```sh
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use node
```

#### Monitor processes

`pm2 monit`

#### Output process logs to a file

`pm2 logs > pm2.log`

#### Restart all processes

`pm2 restart all`

#### Kill all processes

`pm2 stop all`
