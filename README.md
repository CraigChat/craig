# craig-next

This is the future monorepo structure for Craig. At the moment, only ferret (the new download page), ennuizel streamer, and the new kitchen app is in here. Eventually this will be moved to the main repo once all apps are migrated, but in order to get new stuff out first, this is an intermediary repository.

The goal here is to be easily self-hostable, dockerized, and running using environment variables rather than various config files.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute, you can use a development container to do so as that should be set up.
